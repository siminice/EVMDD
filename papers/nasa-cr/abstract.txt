We describe an algebra of Edge-Valued Decision Diagrams (EVMDDs) to
encode arithmetic functions and its implementation in a model checking
library along with state-of-the-art algorithms for building the
transition relation and the state space of discrete state systems.

We provide efficient algorithms for manipulating EVMDDs and give upper
bounds of the theoretical time complexity of these algorithms for all
basic arithmetic and relational operators. We also demonstrate that the
time complexity of the generic recursive algorithm for applying a binary
operator on EVMDDs is no worse than that of Multi-Terminal Decision
Diagrams.

We have implemented a new symbolic model checker with the intention to
represent in one formalism the best techniques available at the moment
across a spectrum of existing tools: EVMDDs for encoding arithmetic
expressions, identity-reduced MDDs for representing the transition
relation, and the saturation algorithm for reachability analysis. We
compare our new symbolic model checking EVMDD library with the widely
used CUDD package and show that, in many cases, our tool is several
orders of magnitude faster than CUDD.
