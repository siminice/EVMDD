\FOIL{Difficulties and approaches}

\vfill
Two difficulties:

\LIST{
\CIRC \RED{huge state spaces}:
the primary obstacle to formal verification
%due to the obvious limitation of computational resources.
\CIRC \RED{potentially large number of (terminal) SCCs}:
a bottleneck for SCC enumeration algorithms
}


\vfill

We propose two approaches based on previous ideas:
\STRESS{the Xie-Beerel algorithm} and \STRESS{transitive closure}
\LIST{
\BULL \STRESS{Saturation} helps cope with the complexity of state-space exploration
\BULL To cope with a large number of SCCs,
we use a \STRESS{transitive closure}-based algorithm:
    \LIST{
    \CIRC Computing transitive closure based on saturation
    \CIRC Can support the computation of recurrent states 
    }
