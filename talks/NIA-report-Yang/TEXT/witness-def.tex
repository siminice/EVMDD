\BULL Witness generation is an automated technique to find an execution of the system conforming to a given property, is a useful feature of model checker 
in debugging.
    \LIST{
    \CIRC To find the \emph{shortest} witness is an interesting problem in both theory and application.
    }

\BULL The existence of SCCs is often correlates with some properties in the system, such as \emph{live lock}.

\BULL Objective: to find the shortest path consisting of a loop and a path from an initial state to that loop.
