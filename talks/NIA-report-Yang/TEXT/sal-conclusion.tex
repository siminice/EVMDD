\STRESS{Summary: }

\LIST{
\BULL The new SAL supports more expressive syntax than our prototype tool.

\BULL EVMDD provides an elegant and efficient way of handling the arithmetic operations.

\BULL The new SAL using saturation algorithm consistently improves on the old implementation in state-space generation for asynchronous systems.
