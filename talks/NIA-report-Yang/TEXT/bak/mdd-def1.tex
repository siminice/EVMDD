\FOIL{Multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs)}

\vfill

An MDD is an acyclic directed edge-labeled graph where:
\LIST{
\BULL
The only \STRESS{terminal} nodes can be $\0$ and $\1$,
and are at \STRESS{level $0$}
\hfill
\STRESS{$\0.lvl = \1.lvl = 0$}
\BULL
A \STRESS{nonterminal} node $p$ at \STRESS{level $k$}
is associated with a \STRESS{state variable $x_k$}.
\hfill \STRESS{$p.lvl = k$, $L \geq k \geq 1$}
\BULL
For each $i_k \in \sset_k$, a nonterminal node $p$ at level $k$ has
an outgoing edge pointing to \STRESS{child} $p[i_k]$
\BULL
The level of a child is lower than that of $p$
\hfill \STRESS{$p[i_k].lvl < p.lvl$}
\BULL
%A node $p$ at level $k$ encodes the
%\STRESS{function $v_p : \sset_k \times \cdots \times \sset_1 \rightarrow \Booleans$}
%defined recursively by
%$$\STRESS{
%  v_p(x_k,...,x_1)  = \left\{  \begin{array}{l @{~~~} l}
%     p
%     &  \mbox{if $k = 0$} 
%\\[1ex]
%     v_{p[x_k]}(x_{k-1},...,x_1)
%     &  \mbox{if $k > 0$}
%   \end{array}
%  \right.
%  }
%$$

An $L$-level MDD encodes a set of states
$\xset \subseteq \potsset \!=\! \sset_L \!\times\! \cdots \!\times\! \sset_1$
\STRESS{
$$
\vi  \in \xset ~ \IFF ~
 \mbox{the path $(i_L,...,i_1)$ from the root leads to terminal $\1$, corresponding to $\vi$.}
