Two categories of related work:
\STRESS{transitive closure} and the \STRESS{SCC enumeration}

\LIST{
\BULL \STRESS{transitive closure}: Hojati et al.\ presented as
\STRESS{fully symbolic} algorithm for testing $\omega$-regular language containment by computing the transitive closure.

       \CIRC Due to the high complexity of computing the transitive closure, this approach has long been considered infeasible for complex systems.

\BULL \STRESS{SCC enumeration}: \STRESS{the Xie-Beerel algorithm}
combines both explicit state enumeration and symbolic state-space exploration.
