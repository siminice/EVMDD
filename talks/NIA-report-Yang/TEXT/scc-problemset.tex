\FOIL{Strongly Connected Components}

\LIST {
\BULL Finding \STRESS{strongly connected components (SCCs)} is a basic problem in formal verification: 
    \LIST{
    \CIRC LTL and CTL model checking
    \CIRC Language emptiness check for $\omega$-automata
    }

\medskip

\BULL In Markov chain analysis, we need to partition the state
space into \STRESS{transient} vs.\ \STRESS{recurrent} states
\\
(recurrent states are those that belong to \STRESS{terminal SCCs})

\medskip

\BULL It is impractical to enumerate SCCs using explicit algorithms for large
discrete-state models
\\
$\THEN$ ~ use symbolic computation of SCCs

\medskip

\BULL Objectives: symbolically build the set of states in non-trivial
(terminal) SCCs
