\STRESS{Summary: }

\LIST{
\BULL Saturation is effective in speeding up the SCC and terminal SCC computations within the framework of the Xie-Beerel algorithm.

\BULL Our new saturation-based $TC$ computation can tackle some complex models with up to $10^{150}$ states.

\BULL For models with huge numbers of SCCs, the $TC$-based SCC computation
has advantages over Lockstep, which symbolically explores one SCC at a time.

\BULL \BLUE{The shortest witness can be found symbolically by
combining EVMDD and saturation algorithm.} }

Our $TC$-based approach is not a replacement for Lockstep, but
is an alternative worth further research.

For models with unknown number of SCCs, employing both approaches
concurrently could be ideal.

\STRESS{Future work: }

\LIST{
\BULL It is reasonable
to run the two algorithms concurrently, possibly sharing
some of the common data structures, such as the MDDs encoding the state space
and next-state functions.

\BULL \BLUE{EVMDD provides an elegant way of encoding numerical
functions on large state spaces, which can be employed in many
memory-intensive problems.} }
