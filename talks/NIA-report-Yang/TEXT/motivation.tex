\FOIL{Motivation}

\vfill
\LIST {
\BULL Symbolic model checking is one of the state-of-the-art approaches to the
verification of complex systems.
    \LIST{
    \CIRC State-space generation (reachability analysis)
    \CIRC CTL and LTL model checking
	\CIRC $\cdots$
    }

\BULL Many symbolic model checkers have been developed, and most of them are based on
\STRESS{binary decision diagrams (BDDs)} manipulation. 
And \STRESS{CUDD} is the most widely used BDD library.
    \LIST{
    \CIRC NuSMV, VIS, SAL, $\cdots$
	}

\BULL \STRESS{Edge-valued decision diagrams (EVMDDs)} and \STRESS{saturation
algorithm} provide a more efficient approach to state-space generation
and CTL model checking.

\medskip

\BULL \STRESS{Objectives}: 
integrating the EVMDD-based algorithms in the existing model checker SAL, and comparing them with
existing BDD algorithms.
