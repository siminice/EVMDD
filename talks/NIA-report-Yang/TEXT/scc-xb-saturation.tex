\LIST{
\BULL Our algorithms compute $B$ and $F$ separately,
unlike $Lockstep$, which uses the set that converges first to bound the other.
\BULL The complexity of our algorithm and of $Lockstep$ are hard to
compare (one saturation run vs.\ a bounded number of BFS steps)
    \LIST{
    \CIRC Saturation executes a series of lightweight firings instead of
    global image computations, its complexity cannot be captured as a
    number of steps.
    \CIRC Saturation results in more compact decision diagrams during
    state-space exploration, often greatly reducing runtime and memory.
    }
%\BULL 
%Experimental results show that, for most models, the saturation-based
%Xie-Beerel algorithm outperforms $Lockstep$, sometimes by orders of magnitude.
