EVMDD Algorithms for Distance Functions

Breadth First Search, classically used to compute state spaces in
symbolic model checking, not only provides reachability information
but also a minimal distance to the initial state. This information can,
for instance, be used to compute the diameter of a state space or shortest
counterexamples for certain temporal logic properties.
The saturation algorithm proved to be orders of magnitude faster than BFS
for computing reachability but it does not implicitly provide any 
distance information.
A modified version of saturation exists using EVMDD to compute distance 
functions.
We have experimented with algorithms using reachability information to 
improve the distance computation.
