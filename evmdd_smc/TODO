* reduce in saturate_dist.c

* 64bit portability (longs for pointers, ints for contents) ???

* garbage collection heuristic:
  keep trace of the number of calls to ref/unref
  when, say 90% of refs have been unrefed, garbage collect

* comment, cleanup, write doc, ...

* saturation with EVMDD: done, probably bogus (very slow on knights example)

* Support for printing execution traces/counterexamples

-------------------------------
Long term:
* SAL integration
 - BNF of SAL language
 - CUDD mapping -> MDDL mapping

-------------------------------

Theoretical work:
- Extensions 
 - EVMDD2+, for weighted/prioritized, timed tr. relations
 - EV*MDD
    - canonization rule
    - operations with mixed operands EV+MDD with EV*MDD (transformations?)
 - Discrete domains of arbitrary values
 - Interval decision diagrams for hybrid systems
     - state-space construction algorithms

- Connections with SMT solving / decision procedures for arithmetic ??

- ??

TECHNICAL REPORTS:
- EVMDD "algebra" (algorithms to manipulate EVMDDs)
- implementation of the full MDD library (design decisions)
- comparative study vs CUDD
